        <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc. A JavaScript object is a variable that can store multiple values in key-value pairs.</p>
        
        <p>An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.</p>

                    // Display Data from the Object:
                    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
                    person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
